    <p>If we take 47, reverse and add, 47 + 74 = 121, which is palindromic.</p>
    <p>Not all numbers produce palindromes so quickly. For example,</p>
    <p style="margin-left:50px;">349 + 943 = 1292,<br>
    1292 + 2921 = 4213<br>
    4213 + 3124 = 7337</p>
    <p>That is, 349 took three iterations to arrive at a palindrome.</p>
    <p>Although no one has proved it yet, it is thought that some numbers, like 196, never produce a palindrome. A number that never forms a palindrome through the reverse and add process is called a Lychrel number. Due to the theoretical nature of these numbers, and for the purpose of this problem, we shall assume that a number is Lychrel until proven otherwise. In addition you are given that for every number below ten-thousand, it will either (i) become a palindrome in less than fifty iterations, or, (ii) no one, with all the computing power that exists, has managed so far to map it to a palindrome. In fact, 10677 is the first number to be shown to require over fifty iterations before producing a palindrome: 4668731596684224866951378664 (53 iterations, 28-digits).</p>
    <p>Surprisingly, there are palindromic numbers that are themselves Lychrel numbers; the first example is 4994.</p>

    <p>Each character on a computer is assigned a unique code and the preferred standard is ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange). For example, uppercase A = 65, asterisk (*) = 42, and lowercase k = 107.</p>
    <p>A modern encryption method is to take a text file, convert the bytes to ASCII, then XOR each byte with a given value, taken from a secret key. The advantage with the XOR function is that using the same encryption key on the cipher text, restores the plain text; for example, 65 XOR 42 = 107, then 107 XOR 42 = 65.</p>
    <p>For unbreakable encryption, the key is the same length as the plain text message, and the key is made up of random bytes. The user would keep the encrypted message and the encryption key in different locations, and without both "halves", it is impossible to decrypt the message.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, this method is impractical for most users, so the modified method is to use a password as a key. If the password is shorter than the message, which is likely, the key is repeated cyclically throughout the message. The balance for this method is using a sufficiently long password key for security, but short enough to be memorable.</p>
    <p>Your task has been made easy, as the encryption key consists of three lower case characters. Using <a href="project/resources/p059_cipher.txt">p059_cipher.txt</a> (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a file containing the encrypted ASCII codes, and the knowledge that the plain text must contain common English words, decrypt the message and find the sum of the ASCII values in the original text.</p>

    <p>A player starts on the GO square and adds the scores on two 6-sided dice to determine the number of squares they advance in a clockwise direction. Without any further rules we would expect to visit each square with equal probability: 2.5%. However, landing on G2J (Go To Jail), CC (community chest), and CH (chance) changes this distribution.</p>
    <p>In addition to G2J, and one card from each of CC and CH, that orders the player to go directly to jail, if a player rolls three consecutive doubles, they do not advance the result of their 3rd roll. Instead they proceed directly to jail.</p>
    <p>At the beginning of the game, the CC and CH cards are shuffled. When a player lands on CC or CH they take a card from the top of the respective pile and, after following the instructions, it is returned to the bottom of the pile. There are sixteen cards in each pile, but for the purpose of this problem we are only concerned with cards that order a movement; any instruction not concerned with movement will be ignored and the player will remain on the CC/CH square.</p>

    <li>Go to next R</li>
    <li>Go to next U (utility company)</li>
    <li>Go back 3 squares.</li>
    </ol></li>
    </ul><p>The heart of this problem concerns the likelihood of visiting a particular square. That is, the probability of finishing at that square after a roll. For this reason it should be clear that, with the exception of G2J for which the probability of finishing on it is zero, the CH squares will have the lowest probabilities, as 5/8 request a movement to another square, and it is the final square that the player finishes at on each roll that we are interested in. We shall make no distinction between "Just Visiting" and being sent to JAIL, and we shall also ignore the rule about requiring a double to "get out of jail", assuming that they pay to get out on their next turn.</p>
    <p>By starting at GO and numbering the squares sequentially from 00 to 39 we can concatenate these two-digit numbers to produce strings that correspond with sets of squares.</p>
    <p>Statistically it can be shown that the three most popular squares, in order, are JAIL (6.24%) = Square 10, E3 (3.18%) = Square 24, and GO (3.09%) = Square 00. So these three most popular squares can be listed with the six-digit modal string: 102400.</p>
    <p>If, instead of using two 6-sided dice, two 4-sided dice are used, find the six-digit modal string.</p>

    <p>A natural number, N, that can be written as the sum and product of a given set of at least two natural numbers, {<i>a</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>a</i><sub>2</sub>, ... , <i>a</i><sub><i>k</i></sub>} is called a product-sum number: N = <i>a</i><sub>1</sub> + <i>a</i><sub>2</sub> + ... + <i>a</i><sub><i>k</i></sub> = <i>a</i><sub>1</sub> × <i>a</i><sub>2</sub> × ... × <i>a</i><sub><i>k</i></sub>.</p>
    <p>For example, 6 = 1 + 2 + 3 = 1 × 2 × 3.</p>
    <p>For a given set of size, <i>k</i>, we shall call the smallest N with this property a minimal product-sum number. The minimal product-sum numbers for sets of size, <i>k</i> = 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are as follows.</p>
    <p style="margin-left:50px;"><i>k</i>=2: 4 = 2 × 2 = 2 + 2<br><i>k</i>=3: 6 = 1 × 2 × 3 = 1 + 2 + 3<br><i>k</i>=4: 8 = 1 × 1 × 2 × 4 = 1 + 1 + 2 + 4<br><i>k</i>=5: 8 = 1 × 1 × 2 × 2 × 2  = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2<br><i>k</i>=6: 12 = 1 × 1 × 1 × 1 × 2 × 6 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 6</p>
    <p>Hence for 2≤<i>k</i>≤6, the sum of all the minimal product-sum numbers is 4+6+8+12 = 30; note that 8 is only counted once in the sum.</p>

    <p>Each of the six faces on a cube has a different digit (0 to 9) written on it; the same is done to a second cube. By placing the two cubes side-by-side in different positions we can form a variety of 2-digit numbers.</p>

    <p>For example, the square number 64 could be formed:</p>

    <div style="text-align:center;">
    <img src="project/images/p090.png" class="dark_img" alt=""><br></div>

    <p>In fact, by carefully choosing the digits on both cubes it is possible to display all of the square numbers below one-hundred: 01, 04, 09, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, and 81.</p>

    <p>For example, one way this can be achieved is by placing {0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} on one cube and {1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9} on the other cube.</p>

    <p>However, for this problem we shall allow the 6 or 9 to be turned upside-down so that an arrangement like {0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} and {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7} allows for all nine square numbers to be displayed; otherwise it would be impossible to obtain 09.</p>

    <p>In determining a distinct arrangement we are interested in the digits on each cube, not the order.</p>

    <p style="margin-left:50px;">{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} is equivalent to {3, 6, 4, 1, 2, 5}<br>
    {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} is distinct from {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9}</p>

    <p>But because we are allowing 6 and 9 to be reversed, the two distinct sets in the last example both represent the extended set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9} for the purpose of forming 2-digit numbers.</p>

    <p>In the game of darts a player throws three darts at a target board which is split into twenty equal sized sections numbered one to twenty.</p>
    <div style="text-align:center;">
    <img src="project/images/p109.png" class="dark_img" alt=""><br></div>
    <p>The score of a dart is determined by the number of the region that the dart lands in. A dart landing outside the red/green outer ring scores zero. The black and cream regions inside this ring represent single scores. However, the red/green outer ring and middle ring score double and treble scores respectively.</p>
    <p>At the centre of the board are two concentric circles called the bull region, or bulls-eye. The outer bull is worth 25 points and the inner bull is a double, worth 50 points.</p>
    <p>There are many variations of rules but in the most popular game the players will begin with a score 301 or 501 and the first player to reduce their running total to zero is a winner. However, it is normal to play a "doubles out" system, which means that the player must land a double (including the double bulls-eye at the centre of the board) on their final dart to win; any other dart that would reduce their running total to one or lower means the score for that set of three darts is "bust".</p>
    <p>When a player is able to finish  on their current score it is called a "checkout" and the highest checkout is 170: T20 T20 D25 (two treble 20s and double bull).</p>

    <p style="margin-left:100px;"><i>n</i> × <i>n</i> × ... × <i>n</i> = <i>n</i><sup>15</sup></p>

    <p>However it is yet possible to compute it in only five multiplications:</p>
    <p style="margin-left:100px;"><i>n</i> × <i>n</i> = <i>n</i><sup>2</sup><br><i>n</i><sup>2</sup> × <i>n</i> = <i>n</i><sup>3</sup><br><i>n</i><sup>3</sup> × <i>n</i><sup>3</sup> = <i>n</i><sup>6</sup><br><i>n</i><sup>6</sup> × <i>n</i><sup>6</sup> = <i>n</i><sup>12</sup><br><i>n</i><sup>12</sup> × <i>n</i><sup>3</sup> = <i>n</i><sup>15</sup></p>

    <br>
    If we go a step further the equation (<var>x</var>-3)<sup>2</sup>=-4 has two complex solutions: <var>x</var>=3+2<var>i</var> and <var>x</var>=3-2<var>i</var>.
    <br><var>x</var>=3+2<var>i</var> and <var>x</var>=3-2<var>i</var> are called each others' complex conjugate.
    <br>
    Numbers of the form <var>a</var>+<var>bi</var> are called complex numbers.
    <br>
    In general <var>a</var>+<var>bi</var> and <var>a</var>−<var>bi</var> are each other's complex conjugate.</p>
    <p>A Gaussian Integer is a complex number <var>a</var>+<var>bi</var> such that both <var>a</var> and <var>b</var> are integers.
    <br>
    The regular integers are also Gaussian integers (with <var>b</var>=0).
    <br>
    To distinguish them from Gaussian integers with <var>b</var> ≠ 0 we call such integers "rational integers."
    <br>
    A Gaussian integer is called a divisor of a rational integer <var>n</var> if the result is also a Gaussian integer.
    <br>
    If for example we divide 5 by 1+2<var>i</var> we can simplify $\dfrac{5}{1 + 2i}$ in the following manner:
    <br>
    Multiply numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of 1+2<var>i</var>: 1−2<var>i</var>.
    <br>
    The result is $\dfrac{5}{1 + 2i} = \dfrac{5}{1 + 2i}\dfrac{1 - 2i}{1 - 2i} = \dfrac{5(1 - 2i)}{1 - (2i)^2} = \dfrac{5(1 - 2i)}{1 - (-4)} = \dfrac{5(1 - 2i)}{5} = 1 - 2i$.
    <br>
    So 1+2<var>i</var> is a divisor of 5.
    <br>
    Note that 1+<var>i</var> is not a divisor of 5 because $\dfrac{5}{1 + i} = \dfrac{5}{2} - \dfrac{5}{2}i$.
    <br>
    Note also that if the Gaussian Integer (<var>a</var>+<var>bi</var>) is a divisor of a rational integer <var>n</var>, then its complex conjugate (<var>a</var>−<var>bi</var>) is also a divisor of <var>n</var>.</p>
    <p>In fact, 5 has six divisors such that the real part is positive: {1, 1 + 2<var>i</var>, 1 − 2<var>i</var>, 2 + <var>i</var>, 2 − <var>i</var>, 5}.

    We will call a common point T of two segments L<sub>1</sub> and L<sub>2</sub> a true intersection point of L<sub>1</sub> and L<sub>2</sub>  if T is the only common point of L<sub>1</sub> and L<sub>2</sub>  and T is an interior point of both segments.

    <p>We define the <i>rounded-square-root</i> of a positive integer <var>n</var> as the square root of <var>n</var> rounded to the nearest integer.</p>

    <p>The following procedure (essentially Heron's method adapted to integer arithmetic) finds the rounded-square-root of <var>n</var>:</p>
    <p>Let <var>d</var> be the number of digits of the number <var>n</var>.<br>
    If <var>d</var> is odd, set $x_0 = 2 \times 10^{(d-1)/2}$.<br>
    If <var>d</var> is even, set $x_0 = 7 \times 10^{(d-2)/2}$.<br>
    Repeat:</p>
    $$x_{k+1} = \Biggl\lfloor{\dfrac{x_k + \lceil{n / x_k}\rceil}{2}}\Biggr\rfloor$$

    <p>until $x_{k+1} = x_k$.</p>
    <p>As an example, let us find the rounded-square-root of <var>n</var> = 4321.<br><var>n</var> has 4 digits, so $x_0 = 7 \times 10^{(4-2)/2} = 70$.<br>
    $$x_1 = \Biggl\lfloor{\dfrac{70 + \lceil{4321 / 70}\rceil}{2}}\Biggr\rfloor = 66\\
    x_2 = \Biggl\lfloor{\dfrac{66 + \lceil{4321 / 66}\rceil}{2}}\Biggr\rfloor = 66$$

    Since $x_2 = x_1$, we stop here.<br>
    So, after just two iterations, we have found that the rounded-square-root of 4321 is 66 (the actual square root is 65.7343137…).
    </p>
    <p>The number of iterations required when using this method is surprisingly low.<br>
    For example, we can find the rounded-square-root of a 5-digit integer (10,000 ≤ <var>n</var> ≤ 99,999) with an average of 3.2102888889 iterations (the average value was rounded to 10 decimal places).

    <p>Using the procedure described above, what is the average number of iterations required to find the rounded-square-root of a 14-digit number (10<sup>13</sup> ≤ <var>n</var> &lt; 10<sup>14</sup>)?<br>
    Give your answer rounded to 10 decimal places.

        text: `
    <span style="font-size:10pt;">
    </span><p>Tatami are rectangular mats, used to completely cover the floor of a room, without overlap.</p>

    <p>Assuming that the only type of available tatami has dimensions 1×2, there are obviously some limitations for the shape and size of the rooms that can be covered.</p>

    <p>For this problem, we consider only rectangular rooms with integer dimensions <var>a</var>, <var>b</var> and even size <var>s</var> = <var>a</var>·<var>b</var>.<br>
    We use the term 'size' to denote the floor surface area of the room, and — without loss of generality — we add the condition <var>a</var> ≤ <var>b</var>.</p>

    <p>There is one rule to follow when laying out tatami: there must be no points where corners of four different mats meet.<br>
    For example, consider the two arrangements below for a 4×4 room:</p>
    <div align="center">
    <img src="project/images/p256_tatami3.gif" alt="p256_tatami3.gif"><br></div>

    <p>The arrangement on the left is acceptable, whereas the one on the right is not: a red "<span style="color:#FF0000;"><b>X</b></span>" in the middle, marks the point where four tatami meet.</p>

    <p>Because of this rule, certain even-sized rooms cannot be covered with tatami: we call them tatami-free rooms.<br>
    Further, we define <var>T</var>(<var>s</var>) as the number of tatami-free rooms of size <var>s</var>.</p>

    <p>The smallest tatami-free room has size <var>s</var> = 70 and dimensions 7×10.<br>
    All the other rooms of size <var>s</var> = 70 can be covered with tatami; they are: 1×70, 2×35 and 5×14.<br>
    Hence, <var>T</var>(70) = 1.</p>

    <p>Similarly, we can verify that <var>T</var>(1320) = 5 because there are exactly 5 tatami-free rooms of size <var>s</var> = 1320:<br>
    20×66, 22×60, 24×55, 30×44 and 33×40.<br>
    In fact, <var>s</var> = 1320 is the smallest room-size <var>s</var> for which <var>T</var>(<var>s</var>) = 5.</p>

    <p>When one encounters these strings in nature, they are always folded in such a way that the number of H-H contact points is as large as possible, since this is energetically advantageous.<br>
